In class we learned that the best practice when contracting with software developers is to pay hourly rather than a fixed bid for the support.  

This felt counter-intuitive to a number of us, but the logic is persuasive. Here are the reasons why fixed bid is inferior:

Reason #1: Fixed bid contractors typically have to compete to win the work; there will often be 3-5 firms submitting bids.  Those bids appear to be free from the business users' perspective.  However, the cost of a 20/30% bid success rate is incorporated into the bids of each contractor.  So, in essense, you are paying a highly inflated rate just because the contractor is unsure of whether the proposal will be successful.

Reason #2: The amount of time that it will take to complete the project is unknown.  The software developer is incentivized to give a very conserative estimate in order to ensure that the contract is completed on time.  This means that the business team is typically paying for more time than is necessary to complete the project. 

Reason #3: Software developers are incentivized to submit the minimumally feasible code that satisfies the precise specifications in the bid.  In the discussion below, we'll touch on why hourly developers can be incentivized to iterate based upon business needs rather than contract terms. 

Paying software developers on an hourly basis can mitigate a number of these concerns, provided that the following precautions are taken:

Precaution #1: Ensure that the developers are shipping features as often as possible, ideally weekly or more frequently. 

Precaution #2: Ensure that there is a feedback mechanism between the business and the developers, so that changes in direction can be realized as quickly as possible.

Precaution #3: Make sure that the toughest tasks are the first ones completed.  That will ensure that the project is feasible.
