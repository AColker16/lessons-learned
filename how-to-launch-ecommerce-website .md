Before CBS, I was a digital marketing manager at a Fortune 500 transportation company, my role is to lead a e-commerce website launch. As a business manager, I worked closely with my counterpart - Director of IT platform to launch a website which sells over 10,000 trucks online. The project was successfully launched within deadline and I found there are particularly important learnings we can take from th Digital Literacy Class. 

1) Project Definition Stage

- making sure to include not only the IT team lead but also their most senior lead developer. You want to engage the person who has the most tech expertise in the beginning to help you scale the project. 
-  The lead developer can also help you break project into weekly deliverables and help you to identify the big technical obstables (database integration, platform compatability) so you can better track your progress.

- clearly defining business objective trade-offs. 
-   You can't always get what you wanted in the time you want it, so make sure to spend time with developers to prioritize key features. 

2) Project Building Stage

- encourage developers to activly communicate with business teams on:
-  major project obstacles and work-around plans
-  creative ways to acheive the same business goal with much less resouces

- business must be willing to treat the developer team as true business partner and identify a key liaison to communicate. 

3) QA Stage

- Involve active stakeholders from all departments in the QA stage.
- Collect and document bugs - make sure to give developers credit and NOT to blame them for everything, a lot of times it's the legacy system and the increasingly complex OS, or the 30-year old database system that is breaking the website.
