We are all smart people and one day, we or someone we know will have a potentially revolutionary idea. We did a market scan,
analyzed competitors, and found of competetive edge? Now what? Do we spend $1M to build the product until it's the best it can
be? Or do we do something else? 

Step #1: Get a great developer 
-Not a CTO just yet but a great developer 
-Find someone by reaching through your network to see who they think is the best developer in xyz language or go to a trade 
show for that language, talk to a speaker, and ask that speaker which great developer they know would be available? 
-Talk to that developer and figure out a couple of things - look at previous work examples (on GITHUB!), see if there is a culture fit, 
similar previous experience, and perhaps more important - is there a passion for this topic?) 

Step #2: Setting up your team 
-Get 2 developers paired up so they can bounce ideas off each other 
-the hard part of development is not the typing but the problem solving so 2 people working on it may be faster 
-Close contact amongst all team members (even if remote, should have regular meetings) 
-build a culture of trust w/ developers 
-help them priortize and give support on business side 
-see how many commits and understand their roadblocks; rather than impose artificial timelines, help solve the obstacle that is 
preventing the work from finishing 

Step #3: Build...in an angile manner 
-customers may not use the product in the way you imagine so build with low fidelity 
-see how customers use it (and if they will use it) 
-Build rather than focus on documentation 
-Be flexible to change pland and adapt product according to how customers usei t 
-Go Agile and build the hardest part first
